# Simple Coding Rules (Lerim)

This file defines general coding rules for Lerim.
Follow these rules unless Isaac explicitly asks to change them.

## 1) One clear path per feature

For each feature, prefer one clear execution path.
Avoid parallel/duplicate implementations for the same behavior.

## 2) Keep code minimal

Prefer fewer functions and fewer layers.
Avoid helper chains when one function can express the flow clearly.
Choose names that describe one clear action.

## 3) Use strict schemas

Use strict typed models (Pydantic/enums) for important inputs/outputs.
Do not add alias or legacy compatibility layers unless explicitly requested.

## 4) Fail fast on missing requirements

If a package, key, or required config is missing, raise an error.
Do not add silent fallback behavior.

## 5) Config from TOML layers, API keys from env

Runtime config comes from TOML layers (default.toml → user → project → local → LERIM_CONFIG).
Only API keys use environment variables.
Keep config branching short and readable.
Do not add hidden defaults that mask misconfiguration.

## 6) Real tests over mock-only checks

Each file should be runnable in isolation when practical.
`__main__` self-tests should run real paths (no mock/stub self-test flow).
Validate quality of outputs, not only counts/status.

## 7) Remove old paths when replacing logic

When a new path replaces an old one, remove obsolete code.
Do not keep dead compatibility code "just in case."

## 8) Keep docs and rules in sync

When behavior changes, update the related docs and `AGENTS.md` references in the same change.
