{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":"Classic problem. Learning: always use transaction rollback fixtures for database tests instead of truncation. Transaction rollback is faster and guarantees isolation. I'll add a conftest.py fixture that wraps each test in a transaction."},"timestamp":"2026-02-20T09:15:30Z"}

{"type":"human","message":{"content":"The docker build is slow because it keeps reinstalling dependencies. Can you fix the layer caching?"},"timestamp":"2026-02-20T09:25:00Z"}
{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":"Learning: always COPY requirements.txt before COPY . in Dockerfile to leverage layer caching.
